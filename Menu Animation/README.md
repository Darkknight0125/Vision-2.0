🎨 **Hey Designers!**  
Let’s make navigation fun and interactive with an **Interactive Navigation Bar Animation** in **Figma**!  

The goal is to design a **navigation bar** that reacts dynamically to user interactions, such as hover, click, and transition animations, creating a seamless and polished experience.  

✨ **What to Include:**  
- A **horizontal navigation bar** with at least **5 menu items** (e.g., Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact).  
- **Hover effects**: Highlight the menu item when hovered (e.g., underline, glow, or color change).  
- **Click effects**: Add a smooth animation (e.g., a ripple, pop, or highlight effect) for the active menu item.  
- A **transition effect** between pages (e.g., a slide or fade animation).
