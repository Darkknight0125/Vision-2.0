🎨 **Hello Designers!**  
Let’s design an engaging **Countdown Animation** in **Figma**!  

The goal is to create a countdown animation that is visually dynamic and suitable for UI/UX scenarios like timers, loaders, or event starting screens.  

✨ **What to Include:**  
- A **numeric countdown** from a given value (e.g., 5, 10, or 30).  
- Smooth **transition effects** for numbers (e.g., fade-ins, slide-ins, or scaling effects).  
- Add a **unique finishing effect** (e.g., an explosion, color burst, or transition to a new screen).  
- Optionally, combine the countdown with a background animation or subtle UI elements for added creativity.
