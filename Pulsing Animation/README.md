🎨 **Hey Designers!**  
Let’s create an eye-catching **Pulsing Animation** in **Figma**!  

The goal is to design a **pulsing effect** for UI elements that feels smooth, captivating, and visually appealing.  

✨ **What to Include:**  
- A **central element** (e.g., a button, dot, or icon) that exhibits a pulsing effect.  
- Smooth **expansion and fading** of the pulse (e.g., growing circles, glow effects, or ripples).  
- Optionally, combine the pulsing animation with a hover or click interaction for enhanced dynamics.  
- A **seamless loop** for the pulsing animation.
