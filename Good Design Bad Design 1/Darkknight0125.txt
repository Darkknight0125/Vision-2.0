Q - Why the original UI was bad?
=> The green color was not pleasing.
=> In the video section less importance was placed on the actual videos.
=> Video section text covered way too much space.
=> The icons were dull.
=> The game section had start button below, but it should be the first thing to come in sight.
=> Distinguishing on which tab we are on is difficult on home page.

Q - What changes I made?
=> Changed the overall theme to darker as it aesthetic.
=> Fixed the video player by putting videos as the main attraction.
=> The tabs were made colorfull.
=> Placed Start in the middle of screen.
=> Designed the final score card.
=> Icons added wherever importance felt.

Q - How my changes improved the UI?
=> The darker theme pleases more than green.
=> The better video player improved the UX.
=> Visually can be seen on which tab we are on currently.
=> Colors on choosing difficulty makes better UI.
=> The final score card catches more eyes and the game over looks more modern.
=> Correct and skipped list easy to read.
