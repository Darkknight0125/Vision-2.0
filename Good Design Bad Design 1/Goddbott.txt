Changes in First image:
The option for selecting types of videos was present at the middle of the screen, I placed them at top in my UI design. 
The colour scheme used in app was dull, I changed it to brighter colour scheme.
The heading "Teacher's Image" was also present at the middle of the screen which didn't look appealing at all. So, I placed it on top.
The navigation bar is having too many option. I reduced the number by one, other options can be seen by sliding the navigation bar.

Changes in Second Image:
The image of the game used was very small, So I used a larger image.
Also the name the name of the game being played is not shown. I added that too.
Game settings were in the middle. I shifted them to the bottom.
Buttons like "How to Play?" and "Exit" have been moved below the start option.

Changes in Third Image:
I added the game name.
I also added an emoji "OOPS".
The font of "Game Over" was small in the image. I increased it's size.
