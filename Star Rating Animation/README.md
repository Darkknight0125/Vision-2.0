🎨 **Hey Designers!**  
Let’s make user interaction exciting with an **Interactive Star Rating Animation** in **Figma**!  

The goal is to design a **star rating system** that reacts dynamically to user interactions, such as hovering and clicking on stars, creating an engaging and polished effect.  

✨ **What to Include:**  
- A **5-star rating system**.  
- **Hover effects**: Change the star's color when hovered over.  
- **Click effects**: Animate the stars and emojis when clicked (e.g., a pop, glow, or bounce effect).  
- A smooth **reset animation** when deselecting the stars.
